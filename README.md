### About This Project

Swap mapping is a quantum compiler optimization that by introducing SWAP gates maps a connectivity 
unconstrained circuit to an equivalent physically implementable one, which fulfills the 
hardware restrictions. Therefore, the placement of the SWAP gates can be interpreted as a discrete 
decision procedure. In this package, by introducing a structure called **doubly stochastic matrix** (DSM), 
which is defined as a convex combination of permutation matrices, we make the decision process 
smooth. Doubly stochastic matrices are contained in the Birkhoff polytope, in which the vertices 
represent single permutation matrices. In essence, the algorithm uses smooth constrained 
optimization to slide along the edges of the polytope toward the potential solutions on the 
vertices. Also, the algebraic structure of the cost function allows the minimization of both CNOT
count and circuit depth.

The software package includes a novelty visualization tool, based on braid diagrams, that highlights the effect of the swap mapping on the logical qubits. The figure below depicts an example for a Quantum Volume circuit with 8 qubits. Here the black wires represent the logical qubits and the red arcs stand for generic 2-qubit gates.

### How to use
The package can be installed from sources, please refer to [the contributing guideline](CONTRIBUTING.md).
Once it is installed it is available as a routing plugin in Qiskit. To transpile a circuit using this
plugin you have to pass ``routing_method="dsm"`` to the ``transpile`` function. Here is an example 
how to transpile a circuit to a ring-based coupling map. The algorithm works better when ``sabre``
is used for layout.

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, transpile
from qiskit.transpiler import CouplingMap

qc = QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_file("<a path to a circuit>")
cmap = CouplingMap.from_ring(qc.num_qubits, bidirectional=True)

tqc = transpile(qc, coupling_map=cmap, layout_method="sabre", routing_method="dsm", seed_transpiler=123, optimization_level=1)
print(tqc)
```
